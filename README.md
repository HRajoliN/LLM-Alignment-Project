**LLM Alignment Template** is not just a comprehensive tool for aligning large language models (LLMs), but also serves as a **powerful template** for building your own LLM alignment application. Inspired by project templates like **PyTorch Project Template**, this repository is designed to provide a full stack of functionality, acting as a starting point to customize and extend for your own LLM alignment needs. Whether you are a researcher, developer, or data scientist, this template provides a solid foundation for efficiently creating and deploying LLMs tailored to align with human values and objectives.

## 🚀 Overview

**LLM Alignment Template** provides a full stack of functionality, including training, fine-tuning, deploying, and monitoring LLMs using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). This project also integrates evaluation metrics to ensure ethical and effective use of language models. The interface offers a user-friendly experience for managing alignment, visualizing training metrics, and deploying at scale.

## ✨ Features

- **🌐 Interactive Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the LLM, training models, and viewing alignment metrics.
- **🧠 Training with RLHF**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback to ensure model alignment with human preferences.
- **🛠️ Data Augmentation & Preprocessing**: Advanced preprocessing, tokenization, and data augmentation with back-translation and paraphrasing.
- **🔄 Transfer Learning**: Utilize pre-trained models like BERT for improved performance on specific tasks.
- **📦 Scalable Deployment**: Docker and Kubernetes-based deployment with Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA).
- **🔍 Model Explainability**: SHAP-based dashboards for understanding model decisions.
- **📊 User Feedback Loop**: Collection of user ratings for fine-tuning models continuously.

## ⚙️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.8+
- 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose
- ☸️ Kubernetes (Minikube or a cloud provider)
- 🟢 Node.js (for front-end dependencies)

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLM-Alignment-Template.git
   cd LLM-Alignment-Template
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Node.js dependencies (optional for UI improvements):
     ```bash
     cd app/static
     npm install
     ```

### 🏃 Running Locally

1. **Build Docker Images**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:5000`.

## 🚢 Deployment

### ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

- **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
  - Apply the deployment and service configurations:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/deployment.yml
    kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/service.yml
    ```
  - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/hpa.yml
    ```

### 🌟 Canary Deployment

- Canary deployments are configured using `deployment/kubernetes/canary_deployment.yml` to roll out new versions safely.

### 📈 Monitoring and Logging

- **Prometheus and Grafana**:
  - Apply Prometheus and Grafana configurations in `deployment/monitoring/` to enable monitoring dashboards.
- **📋 Centralized Logging**: The **ELK Stack** is configured with Docker using `docker-compose.logging.yml` for centralized logs.

## 🧠 Training and Evaluation

### 🔄 Transfer Learning

The training module (`src/training/transfer_learning.py`) uses pre-trained models like **BERT** to adapt to custom tasks, providing a significant performance boost.

### 📊 Data Augmentation

The `data_augmentation.py` script (`src/data/`) applies augmentation techniques like back-translation and paraphrasing to improve data quality.

### 🧠 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

- **Reward Model Training**: Uses the `rlhf.py` and `reward_model.py` scripts to fine-tune models based on human feedback.
- **Feedback Collection**: Users rate responses via the feedback form (`feedback.html`), and the model retrains with `retrain_model.py`.

### 🔍 Explainability Dashboard

The `explainability_dashboard.py` script uses **SHAP** values to help users understand why a model made specific predictions.

## 🧪 Testing

- **✅ Unit Tests**: Located in `tests/`, covering API, preprocessing, and training functionalities.
- **🖥️ End-to-End Tests**: Uses **Cypress** to test UI interactions.
- **📊 Load Testing**: Implemented with **Locust** (`tests/load_testing/locustfile.py`) to ensure stability under load.

## 🔮 Future Work
